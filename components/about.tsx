            After completing programming-based courses in university and earning a bachelor's degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering, I decided to pursue my passion for software development. I enrolled in volunteer software development internships and acquired the fundamentals of software development through hands-on work. My favorite aspect of programming is discovering creative solutions to problems. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution. My core stack includes C#, C++, Python, and JavaScript, and I am also familiar with TypeScript. I am always eager to learn new technologies and keep my GitHub fresh and updated.

            After starting my working life, I closely collaborated with design and marketing teams. My interest in the field of art drew me into the world of design. "Design" helps me express my creative ideas. I wouldn't call myself a designer, but I like to spend time doodling or using modeling apps.

            When I'm not coding or designing, I love traveling, savoring sushi and exploring the fascinating world of geography. I have traveled to 25 countries so far and want to continually explore the planet I live on. I also enjoy learning new things and am currently learning German.
